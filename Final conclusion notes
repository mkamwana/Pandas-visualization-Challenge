Inferences made from the analysis
male to female ration for the sample was 51% : 49%
Final tumor volume central tendancy in ascending order is as follows
i. ramicane-36.6
ii. Capomulin- 38.1
iii. ceftamin tumors- 59.9
iv. infubinol- 60.1
there is a direct relatioship between volume and weight for capomulin which may be given by the following equation:
v=0.95w+21.55
where v is volume in mm3 and w is weight in g
